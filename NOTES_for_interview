1) when creating branches for different sections of your project, should you delete the branch after you are done with coding the branches desired features and merging it to master?

2)users , i have librarian and consumer, should i have a user table that joins these 2?

3) when editing users, my current code outputs an unorganized hash like so to the patch request
          {"_method"=>"PATCH",
           "name"=>"Alex Mermelada",
           "username"=>"OldUser",
           "age"=>"22",
           "address"=>"Sparta",
           "email"=>"email@",
           "library_id"=>"1",
           "id"=>"14"}
  I would like this to be: where all the updates are nested into a hash that can neatly be inserted into the patch request
  {"_method"=>"PATCH", consumer [   "name"=>"Alex Mermelada",
                                     "username"=>"OldUser",
                                     "age"=>"22",
                                     "address"=>"Sparta",
                                     "email"=>"email@",
                                     "library_id"=>"1",
                                     "id"=>"14"]}
4) rackflash stopped working for alerts

5) libraries/:id  not showing book count for that library

6) /books/:id/edit in the books controller at the patch request,   in the browser i am unable to validate that you can not select 2 libraries then save.   It only saves 1, i would like to have an flash message saying you can only select 1
        the current code with .each enumerable returns the last checked box in to be passed to the update method




7) Book new erb / - What library does the book reside?.  Unable to show the variable @library.name by itself and to have that variable transfer through the form onto the post request to create the new book
      HOW DO YOU LOCK A FORM INPUT VALUE or pass an instance variable through the form to the post request
8) Section new workaround possible ,Library controller '/libraries/:id/sections/new', at get request add to the session what the new session id would be, to be viewed in post

Notes w luisa

9) XXXX nest parameter for all resources to enable maaaaass assignment
        updated controllers and views for
            consumers
            	     onboarding
                  	edit
                    signup - application controller for consumers and librarians
            Librarians
                  	onboarding
                  	edit
            Books
                  	new
                  	edit
            Library
                  	new
                  	edit
            Section
                  	new
                  	edit

10) XXXXXmake all controllers inherit from ApplicationController ie get rid of helper controller

11) GET requests should only get. POST requests should only post.
      rendering (ie erb: blah blah ) should not be used in post requests, only redirects should be used

      onboarding should not have a route-
            ApplicationController
                  - not changing 67 / 80 for onboarding librarians and consumers. I do not want my users to be able to navigate to the route /consumers/:id/onboarding.  I want this to be a temporary flow page after creating a new account.  If the user makes a mistake during the signup process, they can add the necesssary values at the edit page.
            consumer controller - line 13, 16, 27
            LibrarianController - line 26, 29, 33, 44

OPtional: 12) Make Comsumers and Librarians utilize one User model

OPtional: 13) Model Validations in sinatra (rails guide on model validations works as well)
            - section model line 6 difficult applying message to validations
            - added code to section new views and new model, and section controller, issue is that the new views page does not recognize @section


14) Blog post on the topic of your choice related to the changes made
15) Make another appointment

when done setup an appointment with @luisa
