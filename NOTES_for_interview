1) when creating branches for different sections of your project, should you delete the branch after you are done with coding the branches desired features and merging it to master?

2)users , i have librarian and consumer, should i have a user table that joins these 2?

3) when editing users, my current code outputs an unorganized hash like so to the patch request
          {"_method"=>"PATCH",
           "name"=>"Alex Mermelada",
           "username"=>"OldUser",
           "age"=>"22",
           "address"=>"Sparta",
           "email"=>"email@",
           "library_id"=>"1",
           "id"=>"14"}
  I would like this to be: where all the updates are nested into a hash that can neatly be inserted into the patch request
  {"_method"=>"PATCH", consumer [   "name"=>"Alex Mermelada",
                                     "username"=>"OldUser",
                                     "age"=>"22",
                                     "address"=>"Sparta",
                                     "email"=>"email@",
                                     "library_id"=>"1",
                                     "id"=>"14"]}
